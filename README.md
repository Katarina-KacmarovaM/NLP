# Sentiment Analysis 📊

A **Sentiment Analysis** is my project that analyzes text data to determine sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or  negative ). The project is implemented in **Python** using libraries like  Pandas, Numpy, Nltk or Matplotlib. The sentiment analysis is performed without machine learning.
It cleans text, extracts meaningful words, generates random sentences, and classifies words as **positive** or **negative** using a predefined word list.
